# Chess Engine in TypeScript

## Overview

This project is a Chess engine implemented in TypeScript, which began as a personal challenge to be accomplished during my free time. The primary goal of the project was to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) on a more advanced level than the usual bowling or fizzbuzz katas. After completing the initial implementation, I decided to take it a step further and explore the feasibility of turning the engine into a multiplayer game.

## Features

- Chess engine implemented in TypeScript with a focus on clean, well-structured code.
- Test-Driven Development approach, ensuring high-quality code and ease of maintenance.
- Multiplayer functionality added to enable engaging gameplay with friends and family.
- Full set of chess rules, including castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.
